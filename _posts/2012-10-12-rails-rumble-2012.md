This weekend (Oct. 13—14) I'll be participating in the recently resurrected [Rails Rumble](http://railsrumble.com), along with the amazing backend chops of Jakob Skjerning ([@mentalizer](https://twitter.com/mentalizer)), Jacob Tjørnholm ([@chopmo](https://twitter.com/chopmo)) and Laust Rud Jacobsen ([@laustrud](https://twitter.com/laustrud)).

Obviously, I'll be doing the UI and a lot of the frontend of our entry. I definitely look forward to working with, and learning from, these guys.

Can't say much about our plans for the app yet, but you can follow along and root for us on [the Rumble entry page](http://railsrumble.com/entries/159-polltergeist).
