<strong>Minimizing waste in the design cycle</strong>

This is the first in a series of posts about being efficient when exploring solutions to a design. Sketching, wireframing, Photoshop and HTML/CSS each have their place in certain phases of the process. With this series, I want to give you an idea of which method to employ and highlight the advantages and pitfalls of each.

I recently took a new job and switched from working with content-heavy sites to a task-oriented web application. This is an entirely new field for me, and it's got me thinking about how I approach my work as a designer.

When I work on a feature or flow, I actively question my thoughts & decisions: "how does this help the user?", "does it make sense?", "will it be easy to code?", etc.

If/when I catch myself making little or no progress towards a solution, I've found that it's usually because of a lack of feedback. As designers, we all know the feeling of "going in circles" and I consider this a wasteful part of the process.

Iterative design is all about spending as little effort as possible -but no less– to make an informed decision and then ship the work, so that our feedback loop(s) may tell us where to go next. So what exactly constitutes "as little effort as possible", and how can we minimize waste in the design process?

**Sketching**

A simple sketch is the natural place to begin exploring possible solutions. Most of us keep a pad and pen readily available at all times, and for good reason – this is by far the fastest way to visualize your thoughts. However, the low fidelity of the good ol' sketch can sometimes hinder your ability to see if the direction you're taking is worth pursuing.

Sketching should be for quick explorations of abstract concepts, isolated UI elements or for outlining high-level flows (how does one get from A to B, what screens are necessary, etc.)

Whenever I draw up an idea, the sketch primarily serves as a vehicle for bouncing ideas off of my co-worker(s). These discussions then serve as a litmus test of how well I've thought through the proposed solution, and especially if it's time to move on to a higher fidelity. This usually becomes abundantly clear if a teammate expresses the need to see things in greater detail, in order to see the big picture.

Remember, your sketch is just that: a doodle. This is why being able to recognize when to sketch, and when to _stop_ sketching, is so important.

_aside:_

I personally prefer big, cardboard-like paper and a chisel-tip pen (danish shop for cheapskates, Tiger, has some great pads at DKK 50,-). This keeps me from thinking about the finer details too soon – much like premature optimization in programming, both of which should be considered wasteful.

I've tried out lots of iPad apps as well and found [Penultimate](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/penultimate/id354098826?mt=8) and [Draft](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/draft/id375570329?mt=8) to be my favorites - the [Ten One Pogo stylus](http://tenonedesign.com/stylus.php) is awesome for drawing on an iPad, by the way.
This is of less importance, of course - what matters is knowing when to sketch, when to stop and where to go next.
