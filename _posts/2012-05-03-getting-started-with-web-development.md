I was asked the other day to compile a list of resources for a friend that wants to get started designing & building for the web. 

As I was compiling the list, it dawned on me how far we've come. When I first started scratching the surface of this wonderful little world of ours, resources were scarce and mostly _HTML for dummies_-type-stuff. Nowadays, there's an immense amount of material available in all sorts and shapes, and I'm especially keen on the recent rise of interactive courses. Sites like Treehouse, Code School and Code Academy are definitely pushing the envelope in this space, and I can only imagine where we'll be 10 years from now.

The following list is what I came up with initially, and I'm posting it here in hopes of expanding it over time. I realize it's quite rudimentary right now, so please chime in with your own list, or even just a single item/link, in the comments.
Think of it from the perspective of a complete beginner, with no prior understanding of how a website is built. Thanks.

## Interactive courses
* [Codeacademy][] - The title says it all: _Web Fundamentals_
* [Treehouse][] - A bit more advanced, but still great if you're just getting your feet wet.
* [Code School][] - Advanced frontend coding (HTML, CSS and Javascript) and programming courses.

## Online tutorials & references
* [W3 Schools](http://w3schools.com/) - one of the first and most content-rich resources. Lots of tutorials and reference pages, all written for novices. The basic HTML & CSS stuff are great starting points, albeit a bit outdated; combine with the HTML5 & CSS3 parts when you've got the basics down. 
* [HTML5 Doctor](http://html5doctor.com/) - a great site for understanding the semantics behind the new additions to HTML, and how, when and where to apply them. It does require an understanding of the basics of HTML, however.

## Books
I had trouble finding the best entry-level books on website design & development, so the books on this list all require a general idea of how websites come to be.

* [Don't Make Me Think](http://amzn.to/IG5NEh), Steve Krug - the usability bible. Mandatory reading.
* [Bulletproof Web Design](http://amzn.to/IG59Xx), Dan Cederholm - a great resource for applying best practices to the way you build websites.
* [Designing with Web Standards](http://amzn.to/IG59Xx), Jeffrey Zeldman and Ethan Marcotte - I've never read this myself, but I'm pretty sure the authors earned some of their stripes with this opus.
* [Every single book from A Book Apart](http://abookapart.com) - every single one is excellent and will prepare you for building the websites of tomorrow.

## General thoughts on web design & development
This list could easily go on forever, but these are _some_ of the people/places I've found to consistenly post great articles on how to build better software for the web:

* [A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/)
* [Ryan Singer](http://feltpresence.com)
* [Des Traynor / Intercom blog](http://blog.intercom.io/)
* Joshua Porter - both [his personal blog](http://bokardo.com) and the co-op [52 Weeks of UX](http://52weeksofux.com/)
* [Method & Craft](http://methodandcraft.com/)
* [Anders Toxboe](http://ui-patterns.com/blog)

Finally, you should check out my earlier post on [how to maximize your productivity](http://cabgfx.com/2012/03/16/removing-waste-in-your-design-process/) when you start designing that awesome thing you have in mind. Oh, and remember: sites with pictures of funny cats will never go out of fashion. Now go and build something!
