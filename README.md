# This is the source for my personal site

This is a custom theme built on top of [Jekyll Boostrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com) and is yours for the taking.
Totally open source, feel free to jack it. But please be a mensch and `rm _posts/*` once you're done cloning.

I plan on elaborating on this and share it properly, once I've gotten my feet sufficiently wet.

Check back later, mmkay?
